# Prezly Theme Starter Kit

Prezly Theme starter kit for your newsroom or blog based on Next.js 10+ framework. Made with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [PrezlySDK](https://github.com/prezly/javascript-sdk), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [ESLint](https://eslint.org) and [Slate Renderer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@prezly/slate-renderer).


As we do not want to tell you how to style your project (CSS vs Sas vs CSS-in-JS vs styled components) and sure as hell do not want to force you on our preferred CSS framework **this theme does not have any styling loaded**. It is intended to be used as a boilerplate to start a new theme from.

## Documentation

### Routes

List of routes we automatically generate:

* **/** : Index page listing stories
* **/[article_slug]** : Article pages with slug provided by PrezlySDK
* **/category/[category:slug]** : Category page listing articles in respective category
* **/sitemap.xml**: Sitemap

### Testing/Token

To ease with development we have created a few sample newsrooms in different categories:

* **The Good Newsroom** [(preview on vercel)](https://theme-nextjs-starter-the-good-newsroom.vercel.app/): A newsroom filled with good news
* **Cookbook** [(preview on vercel)](https://theme-nextjs-starter-cookbook.vercel.app/): Recipes shared by the Prezly team
* **Anonymous Photographer** [(preview on vercel)](https://theme-nextjs-starter-photography.vercel.app/):  Pictures from a photographer. Combination of albums and imagery

A list of tokens/newsroom uuids that can be used to kickstart the theme.

| Name  | API Token  | Newsroom UUID |
|---|---|---|
| Good Newsroom  | `HKcab_nEbab_a7b2fe3a3465d3729772fa5381800ab5a0c30d8d`  | `578e78e9-9a5b-44ad-bda2-5214895ee036` |
| Cookbook  | `TKcab_nEbab_28432b75d3a85a826e51cd0b502a3d76acf98d19`  | `9d90b2c1-aed9-4415-a9fb-82dd3a2a1b52` |
| Anonymous Photographer | `SKcab_nEbab_0b63a6dd0b09286cc99fab93e6e80bfd9aecfbb5`  | `ce8299f6-a293-41df-8ffc-1c064d4401bc` |

### Hooks

Each route (index, category, and story) is wrapped on a `React.Context` to make it easier to get values from the newsroom with a simple hook.

#### Available hooks

Under [`hooks/`](./tree/master/hooks):

* `useNewsroom()`: Get Newsroom object.
* `useCategories()`: Get all categories from newsroom.
* `useSelectedCategory()`: On a category page, gets the current category.
* `useCompanyInformation()`: Used to get information about the company, like the `about` text, social links, etc.

## Other

[`@/modules/Stories`](./tree/master/modules/Stories/index.ts) module exports two variants of stories list pagination:

* `PaginatedStories`: Classic query-parameter base pagination, used in the starter by default
* `InfiniteStories`: Infinite loading of stories with `Load More` button

You can find the examples of the implementation in the [Index page](./tree/master/pages/index.tsx) and [Category page](./tree/master/pages/category/[slug].tsx).
